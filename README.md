# 🎯 Dijkstra's Algorithm Grid Visualizer

A dynamic and interactive visualization tool for Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project lets users set start/end points, draw obstacles, and visually explore how the algorithm finds the shortest path on a grid.
